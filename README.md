# Freedom Runner 

## Overview
This is the source code for an infinite runner with Phaser 3 and TypeScript.  
This game is a project for the "rsclone" assignment in the RSSchool 2020Q3 course.   
I used Phaser 3 + Parcel Template from [here](https://github.com/ourcade/phaser3-parcel-template) with ready bulding tools.
I drew all the textures, sprites, and character animations for the project from scratch.  
As the background with the paralax effect were used stylized images of Minsk also depicted by me in CorelDraw.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository with and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

## Gameplay
In the game, the character runs at a constant speed.  
He needs to avoid collisions with the obstacles along the way collecting prizes.  
To control the character you use the space bar.For a standard jump, a single press is used.For a higher jump, you need to hold down the key in proportion to the size of the jump.
